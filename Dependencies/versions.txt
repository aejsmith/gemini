This list keeps track of all of our pre-built dependency libraries.

Linux binaries are currently built against a Ubuntu 18.04 LTS chroot, which
should ensure compatibility with that or newer distributions.

Windows uses pre-built binaries provided by upstream where available, otherwise
they are built using Visual Studio 2019.
